We will shortly add a runnable jar file to the github page, until then this
is what you'll have to do:

0. Download current master from github.

1. Create a new java project in Eclipse from the downloaded source.

2. Run prepare.sh and add the libraries to the Eclipse project.

3. Export project as an Runnable Jar File.

4. Create .GLaDOS.conf and run GLaDOS with 'java -jar GLaDOS.jar'.
